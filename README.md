# Selenium (not really) auto attendance for ITB

Random shit I made


## How to actually use it

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/KaonWry/Selenium-ITB-SIX-not-really-auto-attendance.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Selenium-ITB-SIX-not-really-auto-attendance
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Edit auth.txt, put your NIM on the first line and password on the second line

````bash
  nano auth.txt
````

Hit the engine and let selenium do the rest

```bash
  python index.py
```
